                Hi, I'm Ishika! I'm a current sophomore at Dartmouth College from Lexington, Massachusetts.
                I am interesting in majoring in both Geography and Computer Science. 
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, playing the violin, and painting.
                Feel free to click on the "Projects" button to see what I've done or the "Connect" button to reach me!

                Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past! <br><br>
                Swipe Right<br>
                <img src="images/swiperight.png" style="width:300px;height:166px;"><br>
                Swipe Right is a video game I helped create highlighting racism and fetishization in the queer community
                as part of the Games for Justice staff team. The game was coded using Renpy and can be played <a href="https://husain-rizvi.itch.io/swipe-right">right here.</a><br><br>
                Spice Cartel<br>
                <img src="images/spicecartel.png" style="width:300px;height:166px;"><br>
                Spice Cartel is the video game of the students that I mentored worked on as part of the Games for Justice program using Gamemaker Studios. The Spice Cartel focuses on issues
                of cultural appropriation, capitalism, and exploitation. The demo of this game can be played <a href="https://d2oublejoker.itch.io/spice-cartel">right here.</a><br><br>
                TONEDx<br>
                <img src="images/tonedx.png" style="width:300px;height:166px;"><br>
                TONEDx is a website I worked on as part of the InternHacks six-week Hackathon in the summer of 2021. TONEDx is a platform designed to provide community for those impacted by medical racism, as well as provide resources to help POC navigate the healthcare industry. 
                The website was made using React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
                The project's GitHub page can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/sne1ha/TONEDx">right here.</a> The design mockup can be viewed <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DpUEV2E9ldH7UUidTxlYaY/TONEDx">here</a>, and the working signup page is <a href="https://test-project-837bf.web.app/">here</a>.
